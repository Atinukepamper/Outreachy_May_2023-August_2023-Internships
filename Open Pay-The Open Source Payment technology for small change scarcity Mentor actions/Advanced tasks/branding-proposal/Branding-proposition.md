1. **Research on already existing similar solutions:**

***Strengths***





***Weaknesses***.





2. **Propose a genuine brand name:** 
>The brand name should be memorable, easy to pronounce, and reflective of the project's personality and values

How about ***"Openpayz"?*** 
 This name reflects the project's goal of addressing the scarcity of small change by using open-source technology to create a new way of making payments. The name is simple, easy to remember, and conveys a sense of innovation and change. Additionally, the name could be accompanied by a tagline such as ***"Small change, big impact"*** to further emphasize the project's mission
 
 Also needed to check if the name used for branding is unique and it has not yet been used by other businesses or organizations. i do this by checking on the domain name availability and apps on play store to make sure it doesnt match the exact name we are using for branding. and all the domains names are available as seen on image below

 4. **Propose a brand colors:** 
>Once validated, the brand colors will be consistent across all marketing and communication materials and reflect project's personality and values.

  
For the color scheme, I suggest using a combination of blue and green. Blue represents trust, security, and professionalism, while green represents growth, innovation, and sustainability. The shades of blue and green can be adjusted to fit your brand's personality and target audience.

Here is a possible color scheme for Openpayz:

    Primary color: #033564 (a medium to dark shade of blue)
    Secondary color: #8CC23C (a bright shade of green)
    Accent color: #f3f3f3 (a warm shade of white to add some energy and excitement to the brand)
Came up with some brand colors which was previously used in the creation of the the logo.
